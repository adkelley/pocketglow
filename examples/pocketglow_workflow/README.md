# Article Writing Workflow

## Features
- Generate a simple outline with up to 3 main sections using YAML structured output
- Write concise (100 words max) content for each section in simple terms
- Apply a conversational, engaging style to the final article

## Getting Started
1. Install the required dependencies
```sh
  gleam build
```
2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```sh
gleam run
```

## How it Works
Currently an article on AI safety is generated.

## Example Workflow

## TODO
- Generalize to allow user to enter their own topic
- Use JSON to replace mocked YAML
